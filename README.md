# Predicting-car-prices
In this project am trying to predict car prices using univariate, multivariate k-nearest neighbors models.        
The data set used in this project contains information on various cars.    
For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more.
